# type of skillet (panos or panorama or template or terraform)

# more complex skillets may express a dependency on another skillet that should be loaded before this one.
# For example, a set of skillets may build off of a single 'golden config' that contains shared configuration
# As this skillet is very simple, there is no need to build on another one.

# determines where in the configuration heirarchy the xml fragment will be set. 'file' indicates the name of the file

# in the 'variables' section.

  This skillet demonstrates a simple REST api call to a PAN-OS NGFW to gather it's system information

# type of skillet (panos or panorama or template or terraform)
type: rest

# more complex skillets may express a dependency on another skillet that should be loaded before this one.
# For example, a set of skillets may build off of a single 'golden config' that contains shared configuration
# As this skillet is very simple, there is no need to build on another one.
extends:

# Labels allow grouping and type specific options and are generally only used in advanced cases
labels:
  collection: Rest Skillets

# variables define the things an operator may customize in this skillet. Things like DNS servers, NTP addresses, etc
# may be customized for each deployment. Each variable will be rendered as a form field in the panhandler application
